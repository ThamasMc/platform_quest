# Platform Quest
A quest to learn about Godot!

## Goal
To learn about some of the basic 2D nodes in Godot, and how they can be put together to make a simple platformer.

Additionally, learn how to connect Godot development with version control, as well as whether the final web based build is something that can be hosted through the project's github page!

Let's see how it goes!

## Deployment
The game is deployed and kept up to date through github actions. Check it out [here!](https://thamasmc.github.io/platform_quest/)

**Note:** If you receive an error page on first load stating that there are namespaces missing, just refresh the page.
